NAME: Zenplify
Personal Development & Productivity Tool

React/React Native for front-end.
Flask or Firebase for backend and real-time functionality.
Firebase for database and authentication.


1. Core Features and Scope

Phase 1: Core Functionality
User authentication (sign-up, log-in)
Basic task manager (create, update, delete tasks)
Calendar integration (manual input for now)
Habits and Goals tracking (without analytics at first)

Phase 2: Advanced Features
Habit consistency tracking
Dependent tasks
Integration with external calendars
Collaborative task management (groups)

Phase 3: AI Features
AI-generated task suggestions
AI-driven schedule adjustments
Smart habit reinforcement
By developing in phases, you can focus on implementing the non-AI parts first and keep expanding.

2. Design & Tech Stack
For a solo developer, choosing the right tech stack will determine how easily you can build, scale, and maintain your app.

Front-End:
React Native (if you want cross-platform functionality for mobile)
Vue.js or React (if it's a web-based app)

Back-End:
Node.js with Express (easy integration with React/React Native)
Python Django or Flask (if you're comfortable with Python and need quick API setup)

Database:
PostgreSQL or MongoDB (depending on your comfort with SQL vs NoSQL)
You could use Firebase for easier real-time database updates and user authentication.

Calendar Integration:
Start with Google Calendar API and iCal formats. External API integrations can be implemented later.

3. Planning Architecture
Since you're aiming for an app that tracks habits, tasks, goals, and even finances, start simple:

User Model: Handle user data, task lists, progress, etc.
Task Model: Manage tasks, with fields like priority, deadlines, categories, etc.
Habit Model: Track habits, along with consistency data (e.g., streaks, missed days).
Goal Model: Goals can be more long-term, with a progress bar based on completed tasks/habits.

4. Building the UI/UX
You could sketch the layout (like your "Main Menu" and side bar). Tools like Figma or even wireframe builders could help visualize your app.

Start smallâ€”create the most basic screens (like task creation, calendar view, and habit tracker), then slowly add more complex features.

5. Testing and Feedback
Even if you're developing alone, it's a good idea to test your app as you go. You can use:

TestFlight for iOS (if you're building mobile)
Local testing on browsers (for web apps)
Get feedback early by allowing a few friends to test it.

6. AI Integration (Later Phase)
Once the app is working well, you can integrate AI to:

Analyze user habits and generate tasks or goals
Auto-suggest adjustments to schedules
Analyze finances (if you integrate a finance manager)
Since you're aiming to avoid too much AI for now, this will help you build the app first with clean logic, and you can layer AI features on later.
